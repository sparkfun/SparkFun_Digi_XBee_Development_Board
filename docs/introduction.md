What's in an XBee? In a word (or two) a lot! The SparkFun XBee Development Board breaks out all the functionality of the XBee 3 series you know and love, PLUS the ability to connect to the cellular network, and (drumroll please) GNSS. This is a "Kitchen Sink" Development Board that breaks out the pin functionality of the XBee, includes 2 USB-C connectors for UART communication and Firmware updates, a Qwiic connector for all those lovely I<sup>2</sup>C sensors, as well as Reset and D0 buttons and the ability to switch between Direct USB and I<sup>2</sup>C. There's also a JST port for a battery. 

The Digi Remote Manager® allows users to easily configure and control from a central platform. Built-in Digi TrustFence® security, identity and data privacy features use multiple layers of control to protect against new and evolving cyber threats. Standard XBee API frames and AT commands, MicroPython and Digi XCTU® simplify setup, configuration, testing and adding or changing functionality.
